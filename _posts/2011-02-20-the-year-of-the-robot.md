intro: As it seems I'm not the only one missing "@robertbrook":http://twitter.com/robertbrook on twitter, this little chap might help bridge the gap. Not quite the same thing, but it looks like he's going to have to do. For now.

### Meet Robot

This is [@robotbrook](http://twitter.com/robotbrook). He's a much smaller and infinitely dafter version of [@robertbrook](http://twitter.com/robertbrook) who's taking a year off. Unlike most of my recent software projects, he's not going to be open sourced because people have started talking to him and it would spoil the fun.

### What does he do?

He cheats mostly, picks up on things the real Robert posts to Pinboard and tweets about it, that style of thing.

### But he talks to me!

You might think that, I couldn't possibly comment.

In the beginning, that was mostly so that people **wouldn't** think he was a Real Boy. Not everybody reads the bio page and some of the early @replies were really funny. No, not yours - yours was cool.

(Yes I have talked to it myself a few times by accident. Despite the fact that I wrote it. Shut up.)

### So you're not going to tell me how it works then?

No. Sorry. I can tell you that there's probably some PHP involved somewhere along the line if that's any help.

### Nothing else to add?

*\*bzzzt ... whirrr\**
