<div markdown="1" class="intro">
  Was in a meeting recently where everyone else had tablets. I had a [Moleskine Volant](http://officesupplygeek.com/notebook-review/moleskine-volant-mini-notebook-review/) and a pen and felt seriously out-geeked.  Time for me to take another look at something smaller than a laptop but larger - and less fiddly - than a phone.

### But I thought you had an iPad?

I do. I've bought it a funky Logitech keyboard cover and everything. It's great for looking stuff up from the comfort of the sofa on a device that starts up right away without the distracting whirring noises and ["toasted skin syndrome"](http://www.nhs.uk/news/2010/10October/Pages/Skin-damage-linked-with-laptop-use.aspx)<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite-1">[1]</a></sup> associated with a full-on laptop addiction.

### So… Why are you looking at buying yet more tech gear you can't afford?

Well, I've had it over a year and, while it's undoubtedly a great gadget, it's seldom been out of the house - unless you regularly rock the messenger bag look (I don't - too cumbersome) the 10" form factor is too big to go into a standard shoulder bag and, unexpectedly, too heavy to be casually taken out of the house on a regular basis. Plus it's an expensive toy to risk damaging or having stolen so, unlike the Kindle, lobbing it into a cloth bag to take as an extra doesn't feel like a good option.

### Got your eye on something particular?

Sort of. Despite my misgivings about Android, I initially thought it was a straight fight between the [Nexus 7](http://www.google.com/nexus/7/) and the [Kindle Fire HD](http://www.amazon.co.uk/kindle-fire-HD-tablet/dp/B0083PWAWU). The Kindle Fire SD variant suffers from a lack of buttons (I've gotten used to being able to turn the volume down without fishing around in a menu) and an excess of reflections so it's the HD version or nothing from where I'm sitting (especially if where I'm sitting is on a train - so many weird reflections to be had). Obviously the iPad Mini's non-conformist 8" - sorry 7.9" - screen was going to make it waaay too bulky and cumbersome to be in with a shout.

### What about the Surface?

Nice idea - love the USB and SD card expansion stuff - but too expensive and too heavy. (Also what's with selling an *n*GB tablet where half of that's full of the OS? No-one else does that, try again please.) Expecting to see good things from Version 2 but like most Version 1 products it's not quite there yet. Or at least, I'm not the target market.

### Fair enough. What'll it be then?

So after playing with all the things at my friendly local department store - and a brief distraction in the form of a *Reduced to Clear* [Sony Tablet P](http://www.sony.co.uk/product/sony-tablet-p/tab/overview/) (eventually ruled out as being too old hardware-wise and, with the dual screen layout, ultimately too weird, to be the right thing despite having the perfect self-protecting fold-it-up-and-throw-it-in-a-bag-or-pocket form factor) - I decided I could get used to Android proper on the Nexus 7 in return for faster hardware with better future support and flexibility vs Kindle's more user-friendly but necessarily locked-down approach. And decided to save up for an iPad Mini.

### Yeah, if you see yourself as a content producer and not "just" a consumer, the Nexus unit has a lot going for it... Wait, what?!

Turns out what I really need is something that's "small enough" - handbag sized and not too bulky - and light. Had to be lightweight. And Apple have pulled off an engineering miracle and made sure that the Mini is the lightest of them all. And the thinnest; very important factors when you're carrying these things around. If you can manage a standard size Moleskine, the iPad Mini should provide [a familiar form factor](http://www.flickr.com/photos/shaderlab/8214807029/).

Oh, plus the "premium" tag of the Apple hardware ensures it'll have the usual suspects falling over themselves to produce the widest range of accessories (read: I really need a keyboard - see also [Joey Hess: "my thoughts are being forced out through a straw"](http://joey.hess.usesthis.com)).

### But there's no Retina display!

Yeah, about that. It's the same screen resolution (and processor spec come to that) as my much-loved iPad2 but on a smaller screen so should, if anything, look even sharper. I'm not convinced about the whole Retina thing, it's pretty and all but [there are costs to this sort of thing](http://www.marco.org/2012/11/12/ipad-mini-cost-of-retina). While I totally get the argument about the iffy value proposition of yesterday's tech at today's prices, I'm not trading in my iPad for performance- or screen-related issues, it's all about the portability for me these days. We'll see if I guessed right this time when I finally manage to find a store that's got one in stock.
